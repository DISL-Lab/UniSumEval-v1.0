You will receive an article followed by a corresponding summary. Your task is to assess the factuality of each summary sentence across nine categories:
* out-of-article error: this error occurs when a summary statement introduces facts, subjective opinions, or new information not found in or verifiable by the article.
* entity error: this error occurs when there is an incorrect reference to a key subject or object in a summary statement, such as using a wrong name, number, or pronoun. * relation error: this error occurs when there is a mistake in semantic relationships within a summary statement, including but not limited to incorrect use of verbs, prepositions, and adjectives.
* sentence error: this error occurs when an entire summary statement contradicts the information provided in the article.
* no error: the summary statement aligns explicitly with the content of the article and is factually consistent with it.

Instruction:
First, compare each summary sentence with the article.
Second, provide a single sentence explaining which factuality error the sentence has. Third, answer the classified error category for each sentence in the summary.
Please do not change the order of sentences in your answer.

Provide your answer in JSON format. The answer should be a list of dictionaries whose keys are "sentence", "reason", and "category":
[{"sentence": "first sentence", "reason": "your reason", "category": "no error"}, {"sentence": "second sentence", "reason": "your reason", "category": "out-of-article error"}, {"sentence": "third sentence", "reason": "your reason", "category": "entity error"},]
